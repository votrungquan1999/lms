# Find Patterns

A structured approach to extract established coding patterns from the existing codebase, so new code adheres to existing conventions.

## Purpose

Avoid introducing new conventions when established patterns already exist for common problems (e.g., error handling, database transactions, API responses, testing).

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define the Scope

Determine what type of pattern you are looking for:
- **Testing Pattern:** (e.g., "How do we mock dependencies?", "What is the assertion style?")
- **Architecture Pattern:** (e.g., "How are controllers connecting to services?")
- **Database/Data Access:** (e.g., "How do we handle transactions, connection pooling, or ORM usage?")

### Step 2: Incremental Exploration (Search Strategy)

Do not attempt to read the entire repository at once — constraint limits will cause failure. Use tools incrementally:

1. **Repo Map:** Identify the core module or folder (e.g., `src/data/`, `tests/e2e/`).
2. **Find Exemplars:** Use `Grep` to find highly relevant files. Look for files with names that imply they handle the concern (e.g., `user.repository.ts`, `auth.service.spec.ts`).
3. **Read Specifics:** Use `Read` to examine 2-3 specific, representative files deeply.

### Step 3: Pattern Extraction

Analyze the files using the **CTCO (Context, Task, Constraints, Output)** framework.

- **Context:** Recognize the domain and framework (e.g., Express.js, Pytest, Next.js App Router).
- **Task:** Identify the *exact* mechanism used to solve the problem (e.g., "Observe how error handling and transaction management is wrapped").
- **Constraints:** Focus ONLY on the pattern, ignoring domain-specific business logic.
- **Output Structure:** Document the pattern in the artifact.

Look for:
- **Imports:** What shared utilities, libraries, or base classes are used?
- **Setup/Teardown:** (For tests) How is the environment prepared?
- **Error Handling:** How are exceptions caught, logged, and thrown?
- **Naming Conventions:** How are variables, functions, and files typically named?

### Step 4: Validate the Pattern

Act as a critic to ensure you haven't captured an anti-pattern or a deprecated approach. Are there consistent repetitions of this pattern across the 2-3 files you checked? If a pattern exists in only one file, it may be an anomaly or an abandoned refactor. Ensure it is established.

### Step 5: Document the Pattern (Artifact)

Write the pattern to `./tmp/pattern-<type>.md` in the project root (create the `tmp/` directory if it doesn't exist) using this format:

```markdown
# Pattern: [Name of Pattern]

## Context
When to use this pattern (e.g., "When creating a new repository for database access").

## Core Elements
- **Libraries/Utilities used:** (e.g., `import { db } from '@/server/db'`)
- **Structure:** (e.g., exported class, functional hook, describe block)
- **Error Handling:** (e.g., Wraps in `try/catch` and returns a standard `ApiResponse`)

## Example Structure
[Provide a sanitized code snippet abstracting away business logic, but preserving the skeleton of the pattern]

## Rules to Follow
1. Always do X.
2. Never do Y.
```

### Step 6: Presentation

Present the artifact to the user and confirm if this pattern satisfies their initial question.

## Best Practices

- Find at least 2 files using the pattern to confirm it's a standard, not an anomaly
- Abstract away business logic to highlight the pure structural pattern
- Do not guess the pattern based on standard industry practices — read the actual repository
- Keep it concise, skeleton-focused, and actionable
