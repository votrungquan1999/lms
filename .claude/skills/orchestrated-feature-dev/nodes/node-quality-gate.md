# Node: Quality Gate

Periodic quality check that reviews recent tests and implementation for issues.

## Input

Read `PLAN_STEPS.md` to identify which steps were completed since the last quality check.

## Execution

### 1. Test Quality Review

Use `@test-quality-reviewer` to review the tests written in the most recent 2-3 steps.

Focus on:
- Are tests reliable (no flakiness)?
- Are assertions valid (actually proving correctness)?
- Are tests sensitive (would catch real bugs)?

### 2. Code Refactoring Review

Use `@code-refactoring` to review the implementation from recent steps.

Focus on:
- Any duplication introduced across recent steps?
- Naming clarity?
- Unnecessary complexity?

**If `@code-refactoring` reports missing test coverage → skip the refactoring review** rather than blocking. The tests exist from the TDD steps.

### 3. Apply Fixes

If issues are found:
1. Fix them immediately
2. Run all tests to confirm nothing broke
3. Note what was fixed

## Output

Report the quality gate result:
