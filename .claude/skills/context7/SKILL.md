# Context7

Query up-to-date documentation and code examples for any programming library or framework using the Context7 MCP server.

## Execution — delegate to a Sonnet 5 sub-agent

You run in the **main session** as a thin coordinator — do **not** perform the steps below yourself:

1. Resolve **the library and the specific question to look up** from the conversation (the one thing only you can see).
2. Spawn **one** sub-agent — `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: general-purpose`, `model: "sonnet"` (Sonnet 5). Pass it the resolved library + question, the workspace `<identifier>`, and the steps below as its instructions.
3. It does all the querying/reading/writing and returns a short summary + the artifact path. Relay those to the user; keep the heavy doc content out of the main context.

The steps below are the **sub-agent's** instructions.

## When to Use

- Looking up API documentation for a specific library
- Finding code examples and usage patterns
- Checking framework-specific patterns and conventions
- Comparing approaches within a library's ecosystem
- Verifying correct usage of library features
- **Prefer this over `@web-search`** when the question is about a specific library or framework

## When NOT to Use

- General programming questions not tied to a specific library
- Searching for blog posts, tutorials, or opinions
- Questions about your own codebase (use file reading tools instead)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Resolve the Library ID

**Always resolve the library ID first** to get the correct Context7-compatible library ID.

```
Tool: mcp__context7__resolve-library-id
Args:
  libraryName: "react"    # The library name
  query: "how to use useEffect cleanup"  # What you're trying to accomplish
```

**Selection criteria** when multiple results are returned:
1. Exact name match (prioritize)
2. Higher Code Snippet count (more examples available)
3. Source reputation: High > Medium > Low
4. Higher Benchmark Score

### Step 2: Query the Documentation

Use the resolved library ID to query specific documentation:

```
Tool: mcp__context7__query-docs
Args:
  libraryId: "/vercel/next.js"  # From Step 1
  query: "how to set up server-side rendering with app router"  # Be specific
```

**Query tips:**
- ✅ Be specific: `"how to use useEffect cleanup function"` 
- ✅ Include context: `"authentication with JWT in Express.js middleware"`
- ❌ Too vague: `"hooks"` or `"auth"`

### Step 3: Apply the Results

1. Read the returned documentation and code examples
2. Adapt examples to fit your project's patterns and conventions
3. Don't blindly copy — adjust for your specific use case
4. If the results aren't helpful, refine your query and try again

## Limits

- **Max 3 calls per question** — if you can't find what you need after 3 Context7 queries, fall back to `@web-search`
- **Max 3 resolve-library-id calls per question** — use the best match available

## Best Practices

- ✅ Always resolve the library ID first before querying
- ✅ Write specific, detailed queries
- ✅ Check the library version matches your project's version
- ✅ Combine multiple query results for comprehensive understanding
- ✅ Fall back to `@web-search` if Context7 doesn't have the library
- ❌ Don't query without resolving the library ID first
- ❌ Don't exceed the per-question call limits
- ❌ Don't include sensitive information (API keys, credentials) in queries

## Output

Write your complete findings to `./tmp/<identifier>/docs-lookup.md` — where `<identifier>` is the caller-provided workspace, or a short ticket-id/slug you derive for this task (create the folder if needed). **If it already holds artifacts from unrelated work, STOP and ask the user rather than overwriting.** Do this before finishing, so the caller and user can review the full results.

- `@create-implementation-plan` - Use during the research phase of planning
